# mdbook Combiner

The utilty aims to help solve the issue of an org having multiple mdbooks spread across repos but also want the option of producing a single mdbook for convenience and searchability of an entire orgs information.

## Notes

Very early days
Hopefully will incorporate gitoxide at a later point to clone repos to extract mdbooks
